# Vacation Time

## Description

This webpage was designed as a vacation suggester, wherein a user enters answers to a survey of 5 questions, and then clicks Submit.  The page will deliver back a name and picture of the best suggestion of a place to visit, based upon their answers.  Although a points value has been assigned as a simple logic for the resulting suggestion, this is not to be taken seriously, as obviously such questions could barely begin to point towards any specific vacation spot. This page is really just for the entertainment of the user.

## Setup/Installation Requirements

Vacation Time was developed using the Google Chrome browser, so for maximum success, the page should be opened in Chrome.  Simply go to the following [link] (http://nedfaulhaber.github.io/vacation-solo-proj2) in order to access the page.
